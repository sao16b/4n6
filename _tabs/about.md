Hello, hello! My name is Sarah Osborn and I'm a 20-something in the digital forensics field.

I took an undergraduate class in digital forensics a few years ago. I loved it, but I took a couple years to explore other potential occupational avenues, collecting a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science, and starting a job with the Air Force. But I kept thinking about that class and how fun it was. I really felt digital forensics for me, with a brain geared toward detail-orientedness and problem-solving. 

So, I started gearing up my skill set, taking classes, getting certified (Security+, Network+, DoD DFE, and GCFE), and doing CTFs. And now, 5 years or so later, I'm starting my dream job as a forensic analyst for the Department of Defense.

When I'm not working or learning, I'm a woman of varied interests. I play the cello and piano, and am studying German and Spanish. I like birdwatching, watching TV, reading, and making meatloaf. And I love cats.
